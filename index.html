            <h1>Dream Trip</h1>
            <img src="images/dreamtrip.png">
            <p>Overview:
              I was tasked to completing a travel app project. i chose to create DreamTrip, an app that helps people plan as a group seamlessly by inviting your friends, family, or colleagues to collaborate and vote on flights and accommodations as well as booking activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              My Role: Sole UX/UI Designer 
              Duration: 5 weeks
              Tools: Figma, Invision, Excel, Zoom, Paper & pencil
            </p>
            <p>
              Problem: Planning a trip with a group can be challenging and time-consuming, often resulting in conflicts and disagreements. Choosing flights and accommodations that meet everyone's needs and preferences can be especially difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solution: The Dream Trip app aims to solve this problem by providing a platform for groups to plan trips together, vote on options, and streamline the decision-making process.

                User Interviews:
                As I set out to design a new tool to help people plan their dream holidays, I knew that understanding their planning process was crucial. That's why I conducted six in-depth user interviews, eager to hear their thoughts and experiences. As I listened carefully to each person's story, I began to notice a common thread: planning as a group was a challenge. Whether it was a family vacation or a trip with friends, people struggled to coordinate their schedules and preferences effectively and efficiently. Armed with this insight, I set out to create a product that would help users collaborate seamlessly and enjoyably, making holiday planning a breeze.

                Kate is a travel enthusiast who works full-time and is currently planning a holiday to the Maldives with her friends. However, she finds group trip planning to be a challenging task and needs help to make the process smoother and more efficient.

            <p>
                Problem Statement:
                Our travel planning app was developed with the goal of providing travellers with a simpler and more efficient planning experience. Based on our research, we have noticed that users encounter difficulties when planning trips together as a team. How might we enhance the group planning experience for our users?

        <h1>Ideate</h1>
        <p>In the Ideate phase of the design process, I conducted a thorough analysis of user needs and preferences, which included creating Value Propositions, User Scenarios, and a Storyboard. Through this process, I gained a deep understanding of the user's pain points and desires, allowing me to craft a product that truly resonates with them. This approach ensured that every aspect of the product was designed with the user in mind, resulting in increased satisfaction and engagement. By conducting this critical groundwork in the Ideate phase, I was able to set the foundation for a successful product that met the needs and preferences of its users.</p>

                Style Guide: 
                I adhered to the iOS guidelines for this app, utilising the SF Pro font and SF Symbols for the icons. Additionally, I implemented the recommended iOS colour palette to ensure a cohesive visual design.

            <h1>Final Reflections</h1>
            <p>
                My first UX project was an enjoyable and enriching experience. While I had many ideas and features in mind initially, continuous feedback from tutors and instructors helped me realise the importance of prioritising the main features. At the end of the project, I was able to create a unique app that addressed a feature gap in the majority of travel apps. This project provided me with valuable learning experiences and fuelled my passion for working in the UX industry. Along the way, I encountered various challenges and made mistakes, but each one allowed me to learn and improve. I look forward to continuing my journey in UX/UI and expanding my knowledge and skills further.
